# bytesyzed
ByteSyzed Micro CPU Emulator

My project was to design and implement an instruction set architecture.

As of now, my ByteSyzed CPU class compiles and executes 55 individual commands.

This is a refactored version that I have fully tested.
To get started: Compile main.cpp and ByteSyzed.cpp and run. (NOTE: You can input a file name in the command line to load and run).

There is an included html documentation which really summarizes this project.

If you really wanna delve into what I did, you can set verbose to true.

Thanks for reading!
