<h1>ByteSyzed: Micro CPU Emulator</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>ByteSyzed is a micro CPU emulator with 256 bytes of memory based off of Orion Lawlor's <a href="https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2005/fall/cs301/uemu/uemu/uemu.html">UEMU</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2006/fall/cs301/funk_emu/">FUNK emu</a> micro emulator architectures. Instructions are loaded from an input file and then executed. ByteSyzed uses scratch and (theoretically) preserved registers to manipulate memory and each other. Powerful things come in small packages. If you desire to use of this emulator, make sure not to byte off more than you can nibble.</p>

<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>Used for storing program instructions, hard-coded values and the stack.</p>

<h3>Registers</h3>
<p>There are 16 one-byte registers numbered 0 through F (in hex). These will expressed as an array with hexadecimal indexes throughout this reference (i.e. register 11 is <code>reg[0xB]</code>). The first 14 registers are scratch registers and the others should not be manipulated directly. The program counter is <code>reg[0xF]</code>, which stores the memory address of the current instruction to execute. The stack pointer is <code>reg[0xE]</code>, which stores values and return addresses.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The instruction encoding is chosen such that everything is a multiple of one byte. This makes machine language programs easy to write in hex. There are currently 55 valid instructions (a.k.a opcodes for operation codes). Instructions vary in size and format. Some take only one byte while others take up to 4 bytes to concisely manipulate the 16 registers and memory. Some use nibbles (or half-bytes) to specify registers and byte-sized values.</p>

<h3>Input File</h3>
<p>The input file consists of machine language instructions, written with up to four instructions per line. Instructions should be encoded in hexadecimal bytes (i.e. <code>0xAB 0xCD</code>) but can be written in octal (<code>0253 0315</code>) or decimal. Instructions larger than one byte will cause a runtime error. Anything after the read instructions is ignored and can be used for comments. Lines that do not start with integers are ignored.

<br>

The first instruction is read and loaded into the memory address of <code>progstart</code>, which is the initial value of the program counter <code>reg[0xF]</code>. Each additional instruction read is loaded into the subsequent (e.g. higher) memory address.
</p>

<h3>ByteSyzed Class</h3>
<p>The ByteSyzed Class has memory and registers stored as arrays of unsigned char. Every aspect of ByteSyzed is a public member. The program start <code>progstart</code> is where the first instruction is loaded (this is stored at the initial value of register 0xE). The bool <code>prompt</code> stores whether or not to display "<code>Enter value: </code>" when getting input from getchar. The bool <code>verbose</code> stores whether or not to display instruction traces. The bool <code>loadVerbose</code> stores whether or not to display results from reading and loading from a file.</p> 

<h3>Debugging</h3>
<p>The debugging suite is a bash shell script which loads and runs manaully-defined debugging files and prints out all memory and all registers to <code>debug.txt</code> and compares the file to the debugging files "theoretically correct" memory and registers using a Python script. Credit to the Python script goes to the illustrious and ubiquitous Jacob Butler. He is just happy to have sunk his pristine fingers into yet another grimy assembly course.</p>

<h3>Author Notes</h3>
<p>The following is a summary of important addendeums:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Everything is a multiple of a byte (and thus stored in a <code>char</code> or <code>char[]</code>), larger values will be modulo 256 (with exception to loading from files).</li>
	<li>Instructions vary in size and format from one to four bytes. When writing in machine language, your program will go haywire if the instructions do not have the correct byte encoding. In other words, the CPU may expect following instruction bytes (that you possibly did not include) and, if it does, it expects them in a particular order (e.g. your byte encoding might be backwards).</li>
	<li>As a general rule the encoding has the destination in the "left-most" memory slot after the opcode and the source(s) in the following "right" memory slot(s) sequentially.</li>
	<li>The program counter <code>reg[0xF]</code> starts at <code>progstart</code>, a public member of <code>ByteSyzed</code>.</li>
	<li>The stack pointer <code>reg[0xE]</code> initially points to the highest memory address whose value is <code>progstart</code>.</li>
	<li>The stack pointer <code>reg[0xE]</code> grows into lower memory (e.g. subtract to increase the size of the stack and vice versa).</li>
	<li>When reading the input file, the first instruction is (basically) at <code>progstart</code>. If there are <code>n</code> valid instructions (e.g. they will be read and loaded) in the input file, the final instruction loaded is located at <code>(progstart+n-1)</code>.</li>
	<li>There is no check currently to validate that the stack pointer <code>reg[0xE]</code> is not encroaching on loaded memory.</li>
	<li>Doing an operation to the program counter <code>reg[0xF]</code> may have odd results. The program counter is incremented by the size (e.g. number of bytes) of the instruction in most cases.</li>
	<li>It is possible (and easy) to have static local variables for functions.</li>
	<li>ByteSyzed is small enough that bugs are easy enough to find by dumping the memory and the registers.</li>
</ul>
